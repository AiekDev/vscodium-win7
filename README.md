# VSCodium - Windows 7, 8 & 8.1 backport
This isn't really a fancy readme but I don't give a shit

## How to remake this yourself:

### 1. Compile VSCodium or get it from the official site
Doesn't matter really, all that matters is you get VSCodium from somewhere

### 2. Get supermium-electron (shoutout to win32)
Supermium-electron is backported electron 28, you can find it here >>> https://github.com/win32ss/supermium-electron/releases/tag/v28-testing

## Now that you have everything you need, you can porting!

### 3. Now, do what I did in that screenshot

</p>

### 4. Replacing @vscode folder

in VSCodium version 1.85.2, the @vscode folder inside of node_modules.asar.unpacked just decided to refuse working with windows 7 & 8 for some reason, to revert this you will have to download VSCodium 1.85.1 and use its @vscode folder OR you can just get it off this github page (i uploaded it here for convenience). Just follow what I do in the image:
